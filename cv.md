I’m a beginner frontend developer. My career path has formed the solid ground for further development. It has improved my communication (including foreign customers), teamwork, analytical and management skills.
<br>
Throughout my life, I’m a self-starter and self-motivated. I completed three courses at htmlacademy.ru and explored tons of materials from all over the internet. I love frontend and I do my best to improve skills and knowledge in this area. As I am interested in growing my expertise, I spend my time learning by watching tutorials, reading developer’s articles, exploring documentation and coding. I keep myself updated and plugged-in.
